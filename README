zoneinfo: A program to query a DNS zone and print out some 
information about. Currently the information includes the 
number of nameserver records and nameserver addresses, whether
or not the nameservers respond to TCP queries, whether or not
IPv6 is enabled, whether or not EDNS0 is supported, DNSSEC deployment 
status and statistics (keytags, algorithms, NSEC3 parameters, DS 
record information etc). Passing the option "-d" will print additional 
debugging information. This code is part of a larger program of mine 
that collects and displays information for a large set of zones in a 
web application.

Pre-requisites:

	Python 2.x
	dnspython module (http://www.dnspython.org/)

Installation:

    * System wide (typically /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin), as root:

        python setup.py install

    * In your home directory ($HOME/bin):

        python setup.py install --home=$HOME

    * Or just copy the "zoneinfo" file to wherever you want to put it.

Example runs:

$ zoneinfo berkeley.edu
DNS Zone: berkeley.edu
Elapsed time for zone check: 3.87 sec
5 Nameserver records
10 Nameserver addresses (IPv4=5, IPv6=5)
DNS/UDP response: 10 of 10 servers
DNS/TCP response: 10 of 10 servers
DNS/IPv4 response: 5 of 5 servers
DNS/IPv6 response: 5 of 5 servers
DNS/EDNS0 response: 10 of 10 servers
All servers for zone respond to TCP DNS queries
Zone advertises IPv6 enabled DNS servers
Zone has DNSSEC enabled
     KSK keytags and algorithms: (12834, 10)
     ZSK keytags and algorithms: (34747, 10)
Zone has published DS (Delegation Signer) records:
     DS digest keytags and algorithms: (12834, 2)

$ zoneinfo google.com
DNS Zone: google.com
Elapsed time for zone check: 0.33 sec
4 Nameserver records
4 Nameserver addresses (IPv4=4, IPv6=0)
DNS/UDP response: 4 of 4 servers
DNS/TCP response: 4 of 4 servers
DNS/IPv4 response: 4 of 4 servers
DNS/IPv6 response: 0 of 0 servers
DNS/EDNS0 response: 0 of 4 servers
All servers for zone respond to TCP DNS queries
Zone does not advertise IPv6 enabled DNS servers
Zone does not have DNSSEC enabled
