ToDo list

* Perform DNSSEC validation (using preconfigured root key)
* Provide option to explicitly set source address of queries
* For 'plain' UDP queries, if truncated response, retry with TCP
* Do more detailed exception handling
* Check open-recursion status
* On dns.exception.timeout, retry (a few times)?
